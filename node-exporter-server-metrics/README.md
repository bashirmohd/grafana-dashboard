Node exporter server metrics.

https://grafana.com/dashboards/405.

This a dashboard to give a quick overview of multiple servers. More than 6 will make the dashboard seem messy, but it will work.

There is effort in trying to make the dashboard work for older versions of node exporter as well as newer.

At the moment we're trying to maintain support for node exporter 0.13, which is the version available through Debian Jessie. Keep this in mind when creating Pull Requests.
